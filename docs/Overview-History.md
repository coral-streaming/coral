[Steven Raemaekers](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/steven-raemaekers-a2120b15) has worked on the Coral platform for over a year now. Steven holds a PhD in Software Engineering from the [Technical University Delft](http://www.tudelft.nl). Steven has performed research on the maintainability and evolution of large software systems. Steven is a big fan of Scala and tries to avoid writing `vars` and `Await.results` unless he really, really has to.
